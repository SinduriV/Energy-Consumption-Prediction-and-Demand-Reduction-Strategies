# **Energy Consumption Prediction and Demand Reduction Strategies**

## **Project Overview**
This project, developed as part of **IST 687 - Introduction to Data Science**, focuses on **predicting energy consumption** and proposing actionable strategies to reduce demand. With rising temperatures and increasing energy usage, this study helps energy providers like **eSC Energy Company** prepare for future energy demands and optimize resource allocation.

## **Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to **build a predictive model** that estimates **energy consumption for the month of July** if temperatures were **5 degrees warmer**. Additionally, we propose **data-driven strategies** to help **reduce energy consumption** and **prevent blackouts** without the need for constructing new power plants.

## **Key Components**
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and merging multiple datasets, including **static house data, energy usage logs, weather data, and metadata**.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Identifying key trends, correlations, and insights using **visualizations and statistical methods**.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Developing a **linear regression model** to forecast energy demand, with an **RÂ² score of 89.85%**.
- **Demand Analysis:** Understanding energy usage patterns and evaluating high-consumption zones.
- **Shiny App Development:** Creating an **interactive dashboard** for visualizing energy trends and predictions.
- **Demand Reduction Strategies:** Proposing solutions like **smart grids, solar power adoption, occupancy-based energy adjustments, and awareness programs**.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Languages:** R
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, Dplyr, Data Merging & Cleaning Techniques
- **Visualization:** ggplot2, Shiny App
- **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression for energy prediction

## **Challenges Faced**
- Ensuring **clean and structured data** for accurate predictions.
- Handling **missing values** and inconsistencies across datasets.
- Balancing **computational efficiency** while merging large datasets.
- Selecting an **optimal predictive model** with the best performance.

## **Conclusion**
This project provided valuable insights into **energy consumption forecasting** and **demand management** using **data science techniques**. Through data-driven decision-making, energy providers can enhance sustainability efforts, **reduce operational costs**, and **promote energy-efficient practices**.
